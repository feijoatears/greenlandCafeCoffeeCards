<h1>Outline</h1>
<p>A very basic coffee card app, made for the purpose of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Replacing physical paper cards</li>
  <li>Saving time when looking for a particular customer</li>
</ul>
<p>This project uses:</p>
<ul>
  <li>TypeScript as the language for type safety</li>
  <li>Electron for the application backend, paired with Forge</li>
  <li>React for user interface</li>
  <li>SQLite3 for local DB management</li>
  <li>Webpack for module bundling</li>
</ul>

<h1>Installing/Running the Application</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Clone repository with 'git clone https://github.com/feijoatears/greenlandCafeCoffeeCards.git' </li>
  <li>Install dependencies with 'npm install'</li>
  <li>If only testing, you can use 'npm run start', otherwise use 'npm run package' to create a .exe</li>
  <li>If you created an exe, the output directory will be under 'out'. You can run the application from here.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>PS: There are some structure issues present in this version, which I hope to address later</p>
<p>PPS: I added a snake game that's playable by using the command 'Ctrl+Alt+S'.<br>This doesn't affect the functionality of the application, it's just an easter egg :)</p>
